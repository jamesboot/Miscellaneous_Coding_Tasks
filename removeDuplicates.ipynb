    "## Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in `nums`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the number of unique elements of nums to be `k`, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:\n",
    "- Change the array nums such that the first `k` elements of nums contain the unique elements in the order they were present in `nums` initially. \n",
    "- The remaining elements of `nums` are not important as well as the size of `nums`.\n",
    "- Return `k`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: `nums = [1,1,2]`\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: `2, nums = [1,2,_]`\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: \n",
    "- Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.\n",
    "- It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: `nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]`\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: `5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]`\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: \n",
    "- Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.\n",
    "- It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores)."
